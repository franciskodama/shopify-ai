### Hi there! I'm Francis Kodama! 👋

## WELCOME TO MY AI PROJECT. 🤖

<hr />

# this.Project 📖

100% React-based, this is my most important project built.

## Why?

Rather than make a "to-do list" project after taking a React course, I thought it would be more productive to build a bold project where I could apply what I've learned and study new things to go beyond what I already knew.
</br>
</br>

## How?

As a product strategist, I began by thinking about how to create a portfolio that would appeal to employers seeking talent with my skills.
</br>
</br>

## What?

From many sketches, designing the project on Figma, to coding afterward, in each step, the portfolio was built intentionally gathering new knowledge and new understandings.
</br>
</br>

## Tech

100% React-based, JSX, CSS, SASS, and HTML. Some tools used: Git, VisualCode, Figma, and Adobe Photoshop.
