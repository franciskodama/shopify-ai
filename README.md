### Hi there! I'm Francis Kodama! 👋

## WELCOME TO MY A.I. 🤖 PROJECT SO CALLED TV HELPER. 📺

<hr />

# this.Project 📖

100% React-based, this is a project that I worked with some engines of artificial intelligence created by OpenAI. They have trained cutting-edge language models that are very good at understanding and generating text. Their API provides access to some models and can be used to solve virtually any task that involves processing language. In my case, I used one of their engines to generate suggestions of what to watch on TV, movies or TV series.

## Why?

Whenever we watch TV, my wife and I always have trouble deciding what to watch. The reason for this is that sometimes we want to watch a comedy, another day a drama, and another day a European film. However, where do you find something so specific? That's where OpenAPI comes into play! With OpenAPI we can use great engines of Artificial Intelligence to help us find the film if we ask very specific questions. Try it!
